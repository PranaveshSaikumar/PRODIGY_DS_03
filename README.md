# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis
This is my repository for Prodigy Infotech Internship! These documents are for the task 3 of my internship program on data analysis and categorical representation.

# Task Obejctive:
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Insights:
The Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository contains demographic and behavioral data of customers, making it suitable for building a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase decisions based on these factors. Key features include age, job type, marital status, education level, and previous marketing campaign interactions.
